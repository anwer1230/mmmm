# Overview

This is a Telegram bot designed for a Saudi Arabian service provider called "مركز سرعة إنجاز" (Speed Completion Center). The bot serves as a marketing and customer outreach tool to promote various academic, technical, and medical services offered by the center. The services include academic research support, student assistance, technical development, design and translation services, and medical document processing.

# User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

# System Architecture

## Core Application Structure
The application is built as a simple Python script using synchronous HTTP requests to interact with the Telegram Bot API. The architecture follows a straightforward approach:

- **Single-file application**: All functionality is contained within `main.py`
- **Direct API integration**: Uses the `requests` library to make HTTP calls to Telegram's Bot API
- **Synchronous processing**: Built with standard Python without async/await patterns (though asyncio is imported but unused)

## Bot Configuration
- **Token-based authentication**: Uses Telegram Bot API token for authentication
- **Environment variable configuration**: Bot token is designed to be set via environment variables for security
- **Static message content**: Marketing message is hardcoded in Arabic text with formatted content

## Message Delivery System
The bot is structured to send promotional messages, likely to multiple recipients or channels. The message content is professionally formatted using Telegram's Markdown formatting with:
- Bullet points and checkmarks for service listings
- Bold text emphasis for important sections
- Structured service categories (academic, student, technical, design/translation, medical)

## Operational Considerations
- **Rate limiting awareness**: Includes time delay functionality suggesting bulk messaging capabilities
- **DateTime tracking**: Imports datetime module for potential scheduling or logging features
- **Error handling preparation**: Structure suggests planned implementation of retry logic and error management

# External Dependencies

## Required Python Libraries
- **requests**: HTTP client library for API communication with Telegram servers
- **asyncio**: Asynchronous I/O framework (imported but not currently utilized)
- **time**: Built-in Python module for timing and delays
- **datetime**: Built-in Python module for timestamp management

## External Services
- **Telegram Bot API**: Primary integration for message delivery and bot functionality
- **Environment configuration**: Relies on external environment variable management for secure token storage

## Infrastructure Requirements
- Python 3.7+ runtime environment
- Internet connectivity for Telegram API access
- Environment variable support for configuration management
